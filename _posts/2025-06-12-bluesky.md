[Rust Fully Asynchronous BlueSky-like study](https://github.com/cyancirrus/bluesky-async-study)

## First Async Application in Rust (and first fully async backend ever!)

Recently, I’ve been trying to wrap my head around using async within Rust.  
I had some prior experience using async in Python, mainly to make non-blocking calls for embeddings of identified terms when they were independent.  
Although I had some background, I was still greatly intimidated — many developers, who appeared far more talented, spoke about how difficult it was to understand Rust's async model.

### Don’t Be Scared — *Jump In*

Surprisingly, transitioning my message-board-like or BlueSky-like app from a LeetCode solution into a fully async backend wasn’t terribly difficult.  
First, I worked through several async problems focused on using notifications and streaming. Then, without much further practice, I jumped in.

The API structure — being mostly async — was really about learning the tools:
- **Axum** for the API tree and server
- **Serde** to handle JSON and the barrier between client and server
- **Tokio** for the async runtime and its async-aware RwLock
- **std::sync::Arc** for atomic reference counting so I could clone handles without cloning the actual data

But my *favorite* package — the standout for me…
-- **DashMap** an amazing tool allowing you to manage interior mutability

## What the Data Looked Like on the Backend

One of the main APIs I needed to port was `fn follow(...)`, which takes in a `followee_id` and a `follower_id`.  
I wanted users to safely write to their own portion of the data — i.e., a user (the follower) clicks *follow* on another user (the followee), and we remember this information.

This was tricky to model. The user should only be able to modify their own data. It should also be fully async.

Originally, the data appeared in synchronous code as:
```rust
HashMap<UserId, HashSet<UserId>>
```
A mapping from user ID to the set of users they follow.  
I used a set to enable quick `unfollow` (O(1)) and to ensure no duplicate follows.

### First Iteration

To model the problem, I initially reached for a `Mutex`.  
Mutexes were useful when solving async LeetCode problems, allowing mutation within async code — so I started there.
```rust
Mutex<HashSet<UserId>>
```

This worked, but it was blocking.  
It was synchronous code masquerading as async.  
Time to explore other structures beyond what I’d seen in my limited Rust async exposure.

### Enter RwLock (Read-Write Lock)

My API could naturally be partitioned into:
- **Read actions**: `NewsFeed`
- **Write actions**: `Follow`, `Publish`, `Unfollow`

This seemed like a natural fit for `RwLock`, so I implemented:
```
RwLock<HashMap<UserId, RwLock<HashSet<UserId>>>>
```

There were only a few code changes: `.lock().await` became `.read().await` or `.write().await`. Overall, the changes were minimal.

`RwLock` was a major improvement over `Mutex` — while `Mutex` allows only a single user or thread to access the data at a time, `RwLock` allowed multiple readers in parallel.  

…but the problem remained: most actions cause side effects (writes), and a single write on the outermost `RwLock` blocked the entire backend — even reads!  
Multiple users writing to different locations — they *should* be able to write independently.  
This separation had to be modelable. How could I drive that separation?

### DashMap: The Sleeper Wizzard 

The problem seemed so simple: just enable read-write locking on the interior data.  
Enter **DashMap** — like Gandalf cresting the hill at Helm’s Deep!

DashMap allows users to mutate their private data without needing explicit mutability, and it’s a near drop-in replacement for `HashMap`.

For example:
```rust
fn follow(&mut self, followee_id: UserId, follower_id: UserId)
```
became:
```rust
fn follow(&self, followee_id: UserId, follower_id: UserId)
```

This helped clean up parts of Axum’s server model and the guarantees needed to build the API tree.  
DashMap enabled private mutation — as long as you handled the interior structure correctly, e.g.:
```rust
DashMap<UserId, RwLock<HashSet<UserId>>>
```

This was exactly the model I was searching for.  
I *cannot* recommend the library enough if you’re facing a similar modeling problem where something feels like it *should* be possible.

## Takeaway

Not only is Rust async — and its tooling — becoming ever more mature and viable in production, but…

**Don’t be scared to jump in.**  
You’ve already solved problems that felt impossible at the time. This is just another challenge.  

When I saw my project handle 1,000 posts from 1,000 users in 0.08 seconds on my 2018 machine, I was thrilled.

Programming isn’t just writing code for things you already know.  
Programming *is* solving new problems, exploring the unknown, and discovering better solutions.

Thanks so much for reading — see you in the next post!
