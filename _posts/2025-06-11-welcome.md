*Welcome to my blog! Inaugural post!*

I'm a mixture of Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and Machine Learning Engineer.
I’m passionate about mathematics, statistics, performant computing, and low-level code.

I’ve been exploring multiple projects focused on numerical computing and different strategies — recently concentrating on matrix multiplication techniques, neural networks, and implementing various algorithms at a low level.

Additionally, I’ve been brushing up on data structures and algorithms to design more performant systems. I have experience with databases, API development, predictive engines, model pipelines, and backend systems for applications.

Here, I hope to track my progress and provide a reference for others making the same journey.
Thanks so much for reading!
