<h2 id="first-async-application-in-rust-and-first-fully-async-backend-ever">First Async Application in Rust (and first fully async backend ever!)</h2>

<p>Recently I‚Äôve been trying to get my head around how to use async within the Rust context.
I‚Äôve had some previous experience using async within Python helping to make non-blocking calls for embeddings of identified terms as they were independent.
Although - I had some prior experience I was still greatly intimidated and had put off learning async within - many developers who appear much more talented had spoke of how difficult it was to understand the model.</p>

<h3 id="dont-be-scared-jump-in">Don‚Äôt Be Scared <em>Jump In</em></h3>

<p>Surprisingly transitioning my message board-like or blueskylike from leetcode into fully async wasn‚Äôt terribly difficult.
First I worked through several problems in async which focused upon using a notifications and then streaming and without much practice I jumped in.</p>

<p>The api structure being mostly async really was just focused around learning the tools</p>
<ul>
  <li>Axum‚Äôs api-tree and server</li>
  <li>Serde to communicate with json and handle the barier between client and server</li>
  <li>Tokio for the async run-time and for the async sync handler RwLock</li>
  <li>std::sync::Arc for having an atomic reference counter for the different people allowing to clone without actually needing to clone the data</li>
</ul>

<p>But my favourtie package which was the stand out for me‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="what-the-data-looked-like-on-the-backend">What the data looked like on the backend</h2>

<p>Within the project one of the main api‚Äôs and handlin I needed to port was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn follow(...)</code> which takes in a followee_id and a follower_id.
I wished to be able to have users write safetly to their own portion of the data ie the user (the follower) clicks follow on a person (the followee) and we remember this information.</p>

<p>This was a little bit difficult to model well the user should only be able to modify their own data, it should be able to be fully async‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The data appeared within the synchronous code as</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hashmap&lt;UserId, HashSet&lt;UserId&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which is simply a mapping from a user id to a set of users that they follow.
A set was used in order to have quick unfollows O(1), as well as knowing all users shouldn‚Äôt duplicately follow other users.</p>

<h3 id="first-iteration">First Iteration</h3>

<p>In order to model the problem I had decided perhaps we use a Mutex.
Mutex was a useful pattern in solving the leetcodes and allowed me to mutate data within asynchronous code to lets start there.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Mutex&lt;HashSet, Mutex&lt;UserId&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This worked but it was blocking. This was fully synchronous code masquerading as the async.
It was time to explore the other structures beyond what I had initially seen in my limited async Rust exposure.</p>

<h3 id="enter-rwlock-read-write-lock">Enter RwLock (Read-Write-Lock)</h3>

<p>My api naturally could logically be modeled and partitioned into both read and write actions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ReadAction: NewsFeed</li>
  <li>WriteAction : Follow, Publish, Unfollow</li>
</ul>

<p>This seemed like a natural way to model the problem so lets implement it.</p>

<p>The data then became modeled as</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>RwLock&lt;Hashmap&lt;UserId, RwLock&lt;HashSet&lt;UserId&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>along with a couple of code changes : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.lock().await</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.read().await</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.write().await</code>, but overall the changes were very minimal</p>

<p>RwLock was a major gain beyond a Mutex (Mutex is like a lock so only a single user or thread can have access to data).
RwLock enabled multiple users to read from the data asynchronously  and in parallel</p>

<p>‚Ä¶but the problem remained, and most of my actions actually cause side-effects and need to be writes
but unfortunately the outer most Read-Write-Lock caused the entire ‚Äúbackend‚Äù to be blocked on a single write and even users reading would be locked during a single write.</p>

<p>Multiple user‚Äôs writing to the same location‚Ä¶ even though they should be seperate b/c a user should only write to their specific point‚Ä¶
<em>This problem should be abled to be modeled. How can i drive this seperation?</em></p>

<h3 id="dashmap-the-sleeper-king">Dashmap the Sleeper King</h3>

<p>The problem seemed so simple‚Ä¶ just read-write lock on the interior data.
Enter Dashmap, dashmap does exactly this, it was like Gandalf the Grey coming over the hill in Lord of the Rings!</p>

<p>Dashmap allows users to write to write to their private data without causing a need for explicit mutability and.. and is a near drop-in replacement for HashMap</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ie</p>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fn follow(&amp;mut self, followee_id:UserId, follower_id:UserId) 
</code></pre></div>  </div>
  <p>became</p>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fn follow(&amp;self, followee_id:UserId, follower_id:UserId)
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>This helped to clear some of the trickier parts of Axum‚Äôs Server model and guarantees needed in order to build the api-tree interface.
Dashmap enables this private mutation as long as you handle the interior part ie as long as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DashMap&lt;UserId: **RwLock&lt;HashSet&lt;UserId&gt;&gt;**</code>.</p>

<p>This was the exact model I was searching for - I cannot recommend the library enough if you are facing a similar modeling problem where something feels like it <em>should be possible</em>.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>

<p>Not only is Rust async and the tooling around ever becoming ever more mature and viable tools in the workspace but‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt be scared to jump in to the technology - you‚Äôve already solved many problems which felt difficult at the time and you succeeded them, this is just one more problem.
When I saw the project handle a 1000 posts with a thousand users in 0.08 seconds on my local machine from 2018, I was incredibly happy.</p>

<p>Programming isn‚Äôt just writing code on things you are familiar with, programming <em>is</em> solving new problems, exploring the unknown and better solutions.</p>

<p>I wish you all the best and thanks for reading!
