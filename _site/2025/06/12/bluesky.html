<h2 id="first-async-application-in-rust-and-first-fully-async-backend-ever">First Async Application in Rust (and first fully async backend ever!)</h2>

<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to wrap my head around using async within Rust.<br />
I had some prior experience using async in Python, mainly to make non-blocking calls for embeddings of identified terms when they were independent.<br />
Although I had some background, I was still greatly intimidated — many developers, who appeared far more talented, spoke about how difficult it was to understand Rust’s async model.</p>

<h3 id="dont-be-scared--jump-in">Don’t Be Scared — <em>Jump In</em></h3>

<p>Surprisingly, transitioning my message-board-like or BlueSky-like app from a LeetCode solution into a fully async backend wasn’t terribly difficult.<br />
First, I worked through several async problems focused on using notifications and streaming. Then, without much further practice, I jumped in.</p>

<p>The API structure — being mostly async — was really about learning the tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Axum</strong> for the API tree and server</li>
  <li><strong>Serde</strong> to handle JSON and the barrier between client and server</li>
  <li><strong>Tokio</strong> for the async runtime and its async-aware RwLock</li>
  <li><strong>std::sync::Arc</strong> for atomic reference counting so I could clone handles without cloning the actual data</li>
</ul>

<p>But my <em>favorite</em> package — the standout for me…
– <strong>DashMap</strong> an amazing tool allowing you to manage interior mutability</p>

<h2 id="what-the-data-looked-like-on-the-backend">What the Data Looked Like on the Backend</h2>

<p>One of the main APIs I needed to port was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn follow(...)</code>, which takes in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">followee_id</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follower_id</code>.<br />
I wanted users to safely write to their own portion of the data — i.e., a user (the follower) clicks <em>follow</em> on another user (the followee), and we remember this information.</p>

<p>This was tricky to model. The user should only be able to modify their own data. It should also be fully async.</p>

<p>Originally, the data appeared in synchronous code as:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>HashMap&lt;UserId, HashSet&lt;UserId&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>A mapping from user ID to the set of users they follow.<br />
I used a set to enable quick <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unfollow</code> (O(1)) and to ensure no duplicate follows.</p>

<h3 id="first-iteration">First Iteration</h3>

<p>To model the problem, I initially reached for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex</code>.<br />
Mutexes were useful when solving async LeetCode problems, allowing mutation within async code — so I started there.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Mutex&lt;HashSet&lt;UserId&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This worked, but it was blocking.<br />
It was synchronous code masquerading as async.<br />
Time to explore other structures beyond what I’d seen in my limited Rust async exposure.</p>

<h3 id="enter-rwlock-read-write-lock">Enter RwLock (Read-Write Lock)</h3>

<p>My API could naturally be partitioned into:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Read actions</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NewsFeed</code></li>
  <li><strong>Write actions</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Follow</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Publish</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unfollow</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This seemed like a natural fit for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code>, so I implemented:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>RwLock&lt;HashMap&lt;UserId, RwLock&lt;HashSet&lt;UserId&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There were only a few code changes: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.lock().await</code> became <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.read().await</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.write().await</code>. Overall, the changes were minimal.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code> was a major improvement over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex</code> — while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutex</code> allows only a single user or thread to access the data at a time, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code> allowed multiple readers in parallel.</p>

<p>…but the problem remained: most actions cause side effects (writes), and a single write on the outermost <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RwLock</code> blocked the entire backend — even reads!<br />
Multiple users writing to different locations — they <em>should</em> be able to write independently.<br />
This separation had to be modelable. How could I drive that separation?</p>

<h3 id="dashmap-the-sleeper-wizzard">DashMap: The Sleeper Wizzard</h3>

<p>The problem seemed so simple: just enable read-write locking on the interior data.<br />
Enter <strong>DashMap</strong> — like Gandalf cresting the hill at Helm’s Deep!</p>

<p>DashMap allows users to mutate their private data without needing explicit mutability, and it’s a near drop-in replacement for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HashMap</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fn follow(&amp;mut self, followee_id: UserId, follower_id: UserId)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>became:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fn follow(&amp;self, followee_id: UserId, follower_id: UserId)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This helped clean up parts of Axum’s server model and the guarantees needed to build the API tree.<br />
DashMap enabled private mutation — as long as you handled the interior structure correctly, e.g.:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DashMap&lt;UserId, RwLock&lt;HashSet&lt;UserId&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was exactly the model I was searching for.<br />
I <em>cannot</em> recommend the library enough if you’re facing a similar modeling problem where something feels like it <em>should</em> be possible.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>

<p>Not only is Rust async — and its tooling — becoming ever more mature and viable in production, but…</p>

<p><strong>Don’t be scared to jump in.</strong><br />
You’ve already solved problems that felt impossible at the time. This is just another challenge.</p>

<p>When I saw my project handle 1,000 posts from 1,000 users in 0.08 seconds on my 2018 machine, I was thrilled.</p>

<p>Programming isn’t just writing code for things you already know.<br />
Programming <em>is</em> solving new problems, exploring the unknown, and discovering better solutions.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for reading — see you in the next post!</p>
